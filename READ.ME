#### Run as it is right now
1. make
2. ./ft_printf
3. give 0 to run all the tests or
4. give a number from 1 to 6 to run the corresponding test

#### Modifiers are saved in the enum modifier (emiflake's suggestion)
the first character is N for Null
the next four characters are for the corresponding modifiers
